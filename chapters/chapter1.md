<exercise id="1" title="Distribution of sensory attributes">

Let import the dataset, do a summary of it and identify quantitative variables (sensory attributes); we're gonna work only on this variables for moment.

<codeblock id="01_01">
</codeblock>

The empirical distribution of a variable is the set of values (or modalities) taken by this variable, and their associated numbers. However, the variables being continuous, it is very rare to have the same value twice for two different individuals.

We therefore choose to make a grouping in classes.

The first point is to represent one variable. Choose it and plot its histogram.

<codeblock id="01_02">
_layout(matrix(1:2,1,2))_ allows you to obtain two graphs on a single window. 
</codeblock>

Here, a lot of information is available to us. The first one is an idea of the representation of the scores given by the judges to the attribute. We that a lot of notes are between 0 and 1. The rest is more homogeneous. As explain previously, this distribution is cut in classes. The cut is set by the argument `breaks`. By default, it is set with the _Sturges_ method, which is the most recommended in the most of the cases. If you specify manually this number,  make sure the number is not too high or not too low.

</codeblock>

We notice however that this histogram represents the frequencies of observations on the ordinate, or more precisely the number of observations of each class. It is the argument `freq = True` that gives us this representation. But you sometimes histograms are plot using Frequency density, the frequency per unit for the data in each class. It is calculated by dividing the frequency by the class width. We change the argument `probability` to `probability = TRUE` to have this representation.

<codeblock id="01_10">
</codeblock>

This notion of density is introduce here, it allows to restrict the frequencies of the classes between 0 and 1. Plot the density for one sensory attributes with the `density()` function of R.  

<codeblock id="01_03">
</codeblock>

The histogram of frenquency density can be superposed to the curve. First, plot the histogram for one sensory attribute and add the line of the density.

</codeblock>

To a better understanding of the dispersion of a quantitative variable, we want to calculate the mean, the standard deviation, the first quartile and the third quartile for each sensory attributes in the dataset `experts`. Do it and save them in a dataframe. 

<codeblock id="01_04">
That is what is expected: 

|     | mean | sd | median | q1 | q3 |
|   :-:  |:-:    |:-:    |:-:    |:-:    |:-:    |
| Spicy | 2.2493056 | 3.149714 | 0.5 | 0.000 | 3.625 |
| Heady | 3.9628472 | 3.893348 | 1.9 | 0.300 | 8.125 |
| Fruity | 3.4868056 | 3.268117 | 2.3 | 0.500 | 6.125 |
| Green | 0.8458333 | 1.678575 | 0.2 | 0.000 | 0.700 |
| Vanilla | 3.1131944 | 3.489471 | 1.2 | 0.200 | 6.000 |
| Floral | 6.1187500 | 3.241251 | 6.8 | 3.775 | 9.000 |
| Woody | 1.2524306 | 1.780262 | 0.5 | 0.000 | 1.525 |
| Citrus | 1.0489583 | 1.750898 | 0.2 | 0.000 | 1.125 |

| Oriental | 3.6993056 | 3.944634 | 1.2 | 0.100 | 8.000 |
| Wrapping | 5.7368056 | 3.415128 | 6.3 | 2.775 | 8.900 |

This indicators can be visualized, plot the boxplot of each sensory attributes.Add the line corresponding to the mean of the attribute.

<exercise id="2" title="Product effect">

The sensory attributes are collected fro differents products, let's take account of this point. Remember the dataset, `Product`, `Session`, `Panelist` and `Rank` must be categorical, do the transformation. 

<codeblock id="01_06">
</codeblock>

The point of interest in sensory analysis is the product effect on each sensory attributes. To begin, plot the density for one sensory attribute and for three product. To do it, you must to use `ggplot2` and `dplyr` libraries.

<codeblock id="01_07">
To reduce the dataframe with the informations you need, use dplyr with :
- `select()` : select the product and the sensory attribute;
- `filter()` : select rows of your products;
- `group_by()` and `mutate()` : calculate the mean for each product.
Next, to plot the graph, you need to use :
- `geom_density()`: plot the density of each product according values of your sensory attribute;
- `geom_vline` : plot the line representing the mean for each product.
</codeblock>

Each sensory attributes has different dispersion depending on the product youâ€™re focusing on, it's the product effect.

The next part focus on the box-plots of the same sensory attribute. Using the same libraries, build three box-plot for three products.

<codeblock id="01_08">
To plot the boxplot, use `geom_boxplot()`.
