<exercise id="1" title="Distribution of sensory attributes">

Let import the dataset, do a summary of it and identify quantitative variables (sensory attributes); we're gonna work only on this variables for moment.

<codeblock id="01_01">
Use the `as.factor()` function.
</codeblock>

The first point is to represent two variables. Choose them and plot their histogram.

<codeblock id="01_02">
_layout(matrix(1:2,1,2))_ allows you to obtain two graphs on a single window. 
</codeblock>

Next, plot the density for each sensory attributes with the `density()` function of R. Try to do it in a single window like before. 

<codeblock id="01_03">
</codeblock>

To a better understanding of the dispersion of a quantitative variable, we want to calculate the mean, the standard deviation, the first quartile and the third quartile for each sensory attributes in the dataset `experts`. Do it and save them in a dataframe. 

<codeblock id="01_04">
That is what is expected: 

|     | mean | sd | median | q1 | q3 |
|   :-:  |:-:    |:-:    |:-:    |:-:    |:-:    |
| Spicy | 2.2493056 | 3.149714 | 0.5 | 0.000 | 3.625 |
| Heady | 3.9628472 | 3.893348 | 1.9 | 0.300 | 8.125 |
| Fruity | 3.4868056 | 3.268117 | 2.3 | 0.500 | 6.125 |
| Green | 0.8458333 | 1.678575 | 0.2 | 0.000 | 0.700 |
| Vanilla | 3.1131944 | 3.489471 | 1.2 | 0.200 | 6.000 |
| Floral | 6.1187500 | 3.241251 | 6.8 | 3.775 | 9.000 |
| Woody | 1.2524306 | 1.780262 | 0.5 | 0.000 | 1.525 |
| Citrus | 1.0489583 | 1.750898 | 0.2 | 0.000 | 1.125 |
| Marine | 0.4673611 | 1.428887 | 0.0 | 0.000 | 0.200 | 
| Greedy | 2.9236111 | 3.489965 | 1.0 | 0.100 | 5.100 |
| Oriental | 3.6993056 | 3.944634 | 1.2 | 0.100 | 8.000 |
| Wrapping | 5.7368056 | 3.415128 | 6.3 | 2.775 | 8.900 |

->>>>>>>>>>>>>>Ajout partie guillaume sur les plot de density avec indicateurs

This indicators can be visualized, plot the box-plot of each sensory attributes.Add the line corresponding to the mean of the attribute. 

<codeblock id="01_05">
</codeblock>

</exercise>


<exercise id="2" title="Product effect">

The sensory attributes are collected for different products, let's take account of this point. Remember the data set, `Product`, `Session`, `Panelist` and `Rank` must be categorical, do the transformation. 

<codeblock id="01_06">
</codeblock>

The point of interest in sensory analysis is the product effect on each sensory attributes. To begin, plot the density for one sensory attribute and for three product. To do it, you must to use `ggplot2` and `dplyr` libraries.

<codeblock id="01_07">
To reduce the data frame with the information you need, use dplyr with :
- `select()` : select the product and the sensory attribute;
- `filter()` : select rows of your products;
- `group_by()` and `mutate()` : calculate the mean for each product.
Next, to plot the graph, you need to use :
- `geom_density()`: plot the density of each product according values of your sensory attribute;
- `geom_vline` : plot the line representing the mean for each product.
</codeblock>

Each sensory attributes has different dispersion depending on the product youâ€™re focusing on, it's the product effect.

The next part focus on the box-plots of the same sensory attribute. Using the same libraries, build three box-plot for three products.

<codeblock id="01_08">
To plot the box-plot, use `geom_boxplot()`.
</codeblock>
